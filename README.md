## Skills

#### Self-driven - Perseverant

12 years ago, I was living in a small town in southern France, studying vocational electronics and working in food processing factories. I decided to push my own limits. I got a Master in Business Engineering, studied in India and Russia, learned languages, I experienced purchasing, sales and project management roles. I was inspired by individuals using entrepreneurship and design thinking to do good. I explored the social innovation ecosystem in London, meeting hundreds of social entrepreneurs and attending hundreds of events. I created and facilitated my own events focused on cultivating social impact leadership, to grow and collaborate efficiently.

#### Fast Learner - Adaptive

When I attended my first design thinking workshop focused on helping social entrepreneurs I was fascinated by how enjoyable and efficient it was to energize people and co-create ideas. I decided to become proficient. I got closed to the core team, I met the leaders, I co-organized events with them and learn on my own. 6 months later, I impressed those leaders, I led events on my own and even one that was bigger than they ever organized in London.

I wanted to explore the BRICS countries, I went to live in Russia as part of my business studies. When I arrived, I knew only the alphabet, I was determined to have a work experience there, so I seized all opportunities to improve my language skills and to understand the culture,  I took additional courses, I offered a lot of language exchanges and I went to plenty of meetups. I impressed the locals, I grew my network and I got a working experience. 

#### Thrives Under Pressure - Resourceful

At Makesense, once I got some facilitation skills, my objective was to organize a bigger event, to find a cross over among  social entrepreneurs, a place where they grow, cook and recycle food, where we could do a full day event with a total of 60 persons involved. In 10 weeks, I found an ideal venue and I created tools and processes to collaborate efficiently with volunteers and partners. We met every week to co-create the programme and to promote the event. As a result, we created an event with 10 social entrepreneurs, from 9am to 9pm, with 90 persons involved, over 10 activities including Design Thinking Workshops, public debate, cooking food surplus. We overachieved.

#### Team Player - Excellent Communicator

As a project buyer of electronic components at Schneider Electric, I was involved in a team in the R&D center, our goal was to standardize electronic components and blueprints in order to reduce costs and increase agility. My first objective was to build a tool that enables each stakeholder to access the relevant data from different sources for each component or module. The second objective was to convince everyone to use it. I met each stakeholder and gathered the relevant data. Thanks to those successful collaborations I created a tool that simplified and fastened a complex decision-making process as well as reduced the number of references was reduced.

#### Analytical thinker

My experiences are very diverse, also because my journey is self-funded. I worked during my studies and at some point, I could have meetings during the day with Oxford Business School MBA students, emerging social entrepreneurs, while on the evening I was working with people from low wage European countries trying to climb the social ladder. This diversity enriched my perspectives, it enabled me to quickly understand the big picture as well as the details of a situation. Collaborators in various projects highlighted my abilities to research, to analyze data, to make decisions, to think critically, to be creative and to communicate efficiently. 

#### Problem solver

My experience at the Makers software engineering bootcamp strongly enhanced my problem solving skills, notably my process of breaking down tasks into small pieces. As an example I got very good feedback on this skill when I was able to facilitate the collaborative process to create user stories, draw diagrams and create the tickets by recording on a white board our collective discussions. Also, working alone, with a pair, with a mentor or with a mentee were very interesting ways to learn from other problem solving methodologies, at each step of the TDD, debugging or refactoring process. Finally, I digged into every step of my process in my [Makers portfolio](https://github.com/AdrienFabre/makers_coding_bootcamp_portfolio).

## Feedback

In addition to the following feedback I kept practicing on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/AdrienFabre) to get precise feedback on my code and improve my refactoring skills.

#### Diptis Hadler - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project

"I was in Team What Zen with Adrien for our final project. I was very impressed with Adrien's contributions in all aspects to the project.

In general he led the ideation and planning sessions that we had, writing notes and diagrams on the whiteboard to capture the salient points from the discussions we were having as a team. This helped us to focus on the key issues and explore ideas more effectively. I particularly liked the way he would ensure that the voice of everyone in the team was heard so that the any decisions the team would make would be achieved through consensus. This aligned well with the goal of our What Zen product.

In some planning sessions he showed his skills in abstracting and modelling our proposed solution in diagrams. Again this helped us all to visualise our product as a team and progress towards solutions.

It was clear that he can code fluently as soon after we settled on the technology stack we would use he did a large part of the code to reach our MVP. He then built on that and improved features, especially on the look and feel of the front-end, showing his skill in refactoring the initial deliverables.

His approach to creating new software is very methodical and while we did not do as much formal TDD in this project as we had hoped we were nonetheless working in a very logical way together, and Adrien can take a lot of credit in keeping the team aligned in that way.

In the second week of the project our team worked very well following Agile processes and Adrien's contribution was a key factor in achieving this. He made sure that we performed the necessary Agile ceremonies and that we iterated and collaborated in our work. I was also glad for the quality of the planning and feedback he gave to us all as we prepared the presentation and demo of our product. This helped to make the last two days of the project very rewarding for me personally.

When it came to investigating new technologies and testing them out he showed his keenness and ability in learning by himself. He got some example code working very quickly by following tutorials and other online resources. When he shared and explained his work it helped the team to understand the possibilities and challenges involved with those technologies."

#### Dan Groze - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project

"I like that you always start tackling a problem with lots of planning, you are a master at diagramming and modelling. This helped all our team during our final project to understand our task better.

I really enjoyed working with you, having spent a difficult week on our Task manager app, being on a deadline and having to learn several new technologies, you were always positive and helped the team a lot with researching."

#### Sherif Shendidy - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project

"It was a real pleasure working with you on our final project at Makers. You were so dedicated, your thoughts were very organised, and it was so helpful the way you diagrammed the options we had and plans/routes we can follow to deliver the required feature.

I liked and respected how brave you were in making decisions involving the use of tools and technologies that we didn’t know even when the time frame we had we so tight, then how focused you were in learning them and successfully implementing them in our project.

You were also a great team player, with great sense of humer and ability engage in a focused fruitful conversation to solve problems and plan for the works ahead of us."

#### Sam Morgan - Makers' Head of Education

"You program fast and fluidly, move quickly around the process, and have inventive and thoughtful approaches to solving tough problems."

#### Rohan Metha - from MakeSense (an open source volunteer-driven network creating design thinking events to support social entrepreneurs)

"Very soon after attending his first event he was eager to jump on board and learn how to facilitate one of our workshops. By conducting these workshops he got to deeply understand several social entrepreneurs and help them figure out how to improve their business. He did these extremely well and soon became part of the core team. 6 months after he attended his first MakeSense workshop Adrien was the lead in organising a large-scale event “Food Glorious Food” tackling food waste with a full day event with workshops, activities, and talks featuring 12 different social entrepreneurs in the food sustainability sector. Adrien found the venue, negotiated using it for free, came up with the concept, created the marketing materials and was directing 6 other volunteers to pull off a really successful event.

Adrien demonstrates a really strong work ethic. If he says he will do something he will go to great lengths to make sure it gets done. I have also found that he learns very quickly. If he is interested in something he will dive head first into it, contacting people to talk to and create opportunities to learn as much as he can by doing. He is a self-starter and very good at finding ways to improve the ways we work together."
