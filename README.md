## About

A curious, self-driven and perseverant **Software Engineer**.
(really curious, to give you an idea, I watched hundreds of [TED Talks](https://ted.com))

I grew from studying vocational electronics up to a Master in business engineering, fascinated by technologies and languages. Derived from my involvement in entrepreneurship, social innovation, and education, I built strong analytical, collaborative and adaptive abilities. 

You can find more about myself on [adrienfabre.dev](http://adrienfabre.dev/)
(for example why, being from southern France, I went to Russia and then London) 

I have just graduated from [Makers software engineering bootcamp](https://makers.tech/), I am looking for place where I can contribute to a culture of innovation, progress and diversity, a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, notably in a compiled language, while also gaining exposure to product management and DevOps.

## Skills

#### Self-driven - Perseverant

As a software developer, being Self-Driven and Perseverant helps me to keep my focus, to always learn and to solve complex problems.

This strong drive enabled me to grow from studying vocational electronics and working in food processing factories, up to getting a Master in Business Engineering, leading design thinking events and collaborating with innovative entrepreneurs.

- Feedback - Rohan Metha - from [MakeSense](https://makesense.org/en/) (open source volunteer-driven network creating design thinking events): "Adrien demonstrates a really strong work ethic. If he says he will do something he will go to great lengths to make sure it gets done. I have also found that he learns very quickly. If he is interested in something he will dive head first into it, contacting people to talk to and create opportunities to learn as much as he can by doing."

- Feedback - Sherif Shendidy - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project: "You were so dedicated, your thoughts were very organised, and it was so helpful the way you diagrammed the options we had and plans/routes we can follow to deliver the required feature."

#### Problem solver - Learning from Collaborations

As a software developer, being a problem solver and learning from collaborations helped me to handle a very large diversity of challenges and to constantly progress.

This process and mindset that I enhanced at Makers software engineering bootcamp helped me to know how to break down tasks into small pieces. For example, working in a group, while brainstorming, I would facilitate and draw on a board what we are trying solve to keep the dicussion focused.

- Feedback - Diptis Hadler - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project: "In general he led the ideation and planning sessions that we had, writing notes and diagrams on the whiteboard to capture the salient points from the discussions we were having as a team. This helped us to focus on the key issues and explore ideas more effectively."

Also, working alone, with a pair, with a mentor or with a mentee were very interesting ways to learn from other problem solving methodologies, at each step of the TDD, debugging or refactoring process, I enriched my own process.

- Feedback - Sam Morgan - Makers' Head of Education - [Full feedback here](https://github.com/AdrienFabre/makers_coding_bootcamp_portfolio#global-feedback-from-makers-head-of-education): "You program fast and fluidly, move quickly around the process, and have inventive and thoughtful approaches to solving tough problems."

#### Analytical Thinker - Learning from Diversity

As a software developer, being an Analitical Thinker and Learning from Diversity helped me to listen deeply my collaborators and to make sense of complex systems quickly.

Having self-funded my journey, I almost always worked and studied, I could have meetings during the day with Oxford Business School MBA students, emerging social entrepreneurs, and on the evening I was working with people from low wage European countries trying to climb the social ladder. This diversity enriched my perspectives, it enabled me to quickly understand the big picture as well as the details of a situation. 

Collaborators in various projects highlighted my abilities to research, to analyze data, to make decisions, to think critically, to be creative and to communicate efficiently thanks to this understanding.

- Feedback - Krzysztof Balejko - Student at Makers - Paring: "Adrien starts each of his projects with careful planing and I was invited to join in before both bowling and front-end API challenges. During the process Adrien has demonstrated his abilities of modelling user interaction. We have used Realtime Board during both sessions for diagraming and general brainstorming."

- Feedback - Dan Groze - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project: "I like that you always start tackling a problem with lots of planning, you are a master at diagramming and modelling. This helped all our team during our final project to understand our task better.


#### Team Player - Excellent Communicator

As a software developer, being a Team Player and an Excellent Communicator helped me to work effectively in groups and embody the Agile values.

Working as a project buyer of electronic components at [Schneider Electric](https://www.schneider-electric.co.uk/en/), I was involved in a team in the R&D center, our goal was to standardize electronic components and blueprints in order to reduce costs and increase agility. My first objective was to build a tool that enables each stakeholder to access the relevant data from different sources for each component or module. The second objective was to convince everyone to use it. 

I met each stakeholder and gathered the relevant data. Thanks to those successful collaborations I created a tool that simplified and fastened a complex decision-making process as well as reduced the number of references was reduced.

- Feedback - Sherif Shendidy - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project: "You were also a great team player, with great sense of humor and ability engage in a focused fruitful conversation to solve problems and plan for the works ahead of us."

#### Fast Learner - Adaptive

As a software developer, being a Fast Leaner and Adaptative helped me to deeply understand new languages and how entire stacks work together.

I wanted to explore the BRICS countries, I went to live in Russia as part of my business studies. When I arrived, I knew only the alphabet, I was determined to have a work experience there, so I seized all opportunities to improve my language skills and to understand the culture, I took additional courses, I offered a lot of language exchanges and I went to plenty of meetups. I impressed the locals, I grew my network and I got a working experience. 

- Feedback - Michael Graham, Sales Expert, MJB Graham Founder, Director of Entrepreneurship at Genisys (Charity): “Adrien has an incredible work ethic blended with a great student mentality. During his time at MJB he proved himself to be a fast learner and demonstrated a willingness to continuously go the extra mile to generate results."

#### Thrives Under Pressure - Resourceful

As a software developer, Thriving under Pressure and being Resourceful helps to prioritize and maintain an Agile pace.

- Feedback - Mursal Hedayat, CEO at [Chatterbox](https://www.chatterbox.io/), FounderForbes 30 Under 30 Social Entrepreneur:
“It was a delightful working with Adrien. He produced a highly engaging and well attended MakeSense workshop for Chatterbox in very little time. He was very attentive to our needs and delivered outputs that far exceeded our expectations.”

- Feedback - Rohan Metha - from [MakeSense](https://makesense.org/en/) (open source volunteer-driven network creating design thinking events): "6 months after he attended his first MakeSense workshop Adrien was the lead in organising a large-scale event “Food Glorious Food” tackling food waste with a full day event with workshops, activities, and talks featuring 12 different social entrepreneurs in the food sustainability sector. Adrien found the venue, negotiated using it for free, came up with the concept, created the marketing materials and was directing 6 other volunteers to pull off a really successful event."

## Feedback

In addition to the following feedback I kept practicing on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/AdrienFabre) to get precise feedback on my code and improve my refactoring skills.

#### Diptis Hadler - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project

"I was in Team What Zen with Adrien for our final project. I was very impressed with Adrien's contributions in all aspects to the project.

In general he led the ideation and planning sessions that we had, writing notes and diagrams on the whiteboard to capture the salient points from the discussions we were having as a team. This helped us to focus on the key issues and explore ideas more effectively. I particularly liked the way he would ensure that the voice of everyone in the team was heard so that the any decisions the team would make would be achieved through consensus. This aligned well with the goal of our What Zen product. In some planning sessions he showed his skills in abstracting and modelling our proposed solution in diagrams. Again this helped us all to visualise our product as a team and progress towards solutions.

It was clear that he can code fluently as soon after we settled on the technology stack we would use he did a large part of the code to reach our MVP. He then built on that and improved features, especially on the look and feel of the front-end, showing his skill in refactoring the initial deliverables. His approach to creating new software is very methodical and while we did not do as much formal TDD in this project as we had hoped we were nonetheless working in a very logical way together, and Adrien can take a lot of credit in keeping the team aligned in that way.

In the second week of the project our team worked very well following Agile processes and Adrien's contribution was a key factor in achieving this. He made sure that we performed the necessary Agile ceremonies and that we iterated and collaborated in our work. I was also glad for the quality of the planning and feedback he gave to us all as we prepared the presentation and demo of our product. This helped to make the last two days of the project very rewarding for me personally.

When it came to investigating new technologies and testing them out he showed his keenness and ability in learning by himself. He got some example code working very quickly by following tutorials and other online resources. When he shared and explained his work it helped the team to understand the possibilities and challenges involved with those technologies."

#### Dan Groze - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project

"I like that you always start tackling a problem with lots of planning, you are a master at diagramming and modelling. This helped all our team during our final project to understand our task better.

I really enjoyed working with you, having spent a difficult week on our Task manager app, being on a deadline and having to learn several new technologies, you were always positive and helped the team a lot with researching."

#### Sherif Shendidy - Student at Makers - Collaborated on What Zen, the final project

"It was a real pleasure working with you on our final project at Makers. You were so dedicated, your thoughts were very organised, and it was so helpful the way you diagrammed the options we had and plans/routes we can follow to deliver the required feature.

I liked and respected how brave you were in making decisions involving the use of tools and technologies that we didn’t know even when the time frame we had we so tight, then how focused you were in learning them and successfully implementing them in our project.

You were also a great team player, with great sense of humor and ability engage in a focused fruitful conversation to solve problems and plan for the works ahead of us."



#### Rohan Metha - from [MakeSense](https://makesense.org/en/) (open source volunteer-driven network creating design thinking events)

"Very soon after attending his first event he was eager to jump on board and learn how to facilitate one of our workshops. By conducting these workshops he got to deeply understand several social entrepreneurs and help them figure out how to improve their business. He did these extremely well and soon became part of the core team. 

6 months after he attended his first MakeSense workshop Adrien was the lead in organising a large-scale event “Food Glorious Food” tackling food waste with a full day event with workshops, activities, and talks featuring 12 different social entrepreneurs in the food sustainability sector. Adrien found the venue, negotiated using it for free, came up with the concept, created the marketing materials and was directing 6 other volunteers to pull off a really successful event.

Adrien demonstrates a really strong work ethic. If he says he will do something he will go to great lengths to make sure it gets done. I have also found that he learns very quickly. If he is interested in something he will dive head first into it, contacting people to talk to and create opportunities to learn as much as he can by doing. He is a self-starter and very good at finding ways to improve the ways we work together."
