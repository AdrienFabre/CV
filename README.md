## Skills

#### Self-driven - Perseverant

12 years ago, I was living in a small town in southern France, studying vocational electronics and working in food processing factories. I decided to push my own limits. I got a Master in Business Engineering, studied in India and Russia, learned languages, I experienced purchasing, sales and project management roles. I was inspired by individuals using entrepreneurship and design thinking to do good. I explored the social innovation ecosystem in London, meeting hundreds of social entrepreneurs and attending hundreds of events. I created and facilitated my own events focused on cultivating social impact leadership, to grow and collaborate efficiently.

#### Fast Learner - Adaptive

When I attended my first design thinking workshop focused on helping social entrepreneurs I was fascinated by how enjoyable and efficient it was to energize people and co-create ideas. I decided to become proficient. I got closed to the core team, I met the leaders, I co-organized events with them and learn on my own. 6 months later, I impressed those leaders, I led events on my own and even one that was bigger than they ever organized in London.

I wanted to explore the BRICS countries, I went to live in Russia as part of my business studies. When I arrived, I knew only the alphabet, I was determined to have a work experience there, so I seized all opportunities to improve my language skills and to understand the culture,  I took additional courses, I offered a lot of language exchanges and I went to plenty of meetups. I impressed the locals, I grew my network and I got a working experience. 

#### Thrives Under Pressure - Resourceful

At Makesense, once I got some facilitation skills, my objective was to organize a bigger event, to find a cross over among  social entrepreneurs, a place where they grow, cook and recycle food, where we could do a full day event with a total of 60 persons involved. In 10 weeks, I found an ideal venue and I created tools and processes to collaborate efficiently with volunteers and partners. We met every week to co-create the programme and to promote the event. As a result, we created an event with 10 social entrepreneurs, from 9am to 9pm, with 90 persons involved, over 10 activities including Design Thinking Workshops, public debate, cooking food surplus. We overachieved.

#### Team Player - Excellent Communicator

As a project buyer of electronic components at Schneider Electric, I was involved in a team in the R&D center, our goal was to standardize electronic components and blueprints in order to reduce costs and increase agility. My first objective was to build a tool that enables each stakeholder to access the relevant data from different sources for each component or module. The second objective was to convince everyone to use it. I met each stakeholder and gathered the relevant data. Thanks to those successful collaborations I created a tool that simplified and fastened a complex decision-making process as well as reduced the number of references was reduced.

#### Analytical thinker

My experiences are very diverse, also because my journey is self-funded. I worked during my studies and at some point, I could have meetings during the day with Oxford Business School MBA students, emerging social entrepreneurs, while on the evening I was working with people from low wage European countries trying to climb the social ladder. This diversity enriched my perspectives, it enabled me to quickly understand the big picture as well as the details of a situation. Collaborators in various projects highlighted my abilities to research, to analyze data, to make decisions, to think critically, to be creative and to communicate efficiently.
